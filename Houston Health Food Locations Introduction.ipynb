As they say in Real Estate, the three most important things are location, location, location. This would be especially true for healthy food alternatives to fast food that are more of a niche product with a more limited clientelle than traditional fast food. The Business Problem I will be solving is to identify high-potential areas in Houston for opening healthy food alternatives to fast food.\n\nWho would be interested: The hypothetical interested party would be an investor looking to open a restaurant that is a healthy food alternative to fast food."
